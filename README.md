# angular-pokemon

Skeleton of an API frontend, initally for use with the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co), but by changing the API constant, can be used for REST APIs that support $resource.

#Technical
NPM  and Bower are used for package management
`npm start` will run necessary installs and start a local server on port 8000.
